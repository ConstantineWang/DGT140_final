# Predicting Student Dropout Rates: An Examination of Student Characteristics and Economic Indicators

This project aims to predict student dropout and academic success based on various student characteristics and academic indicators.

### Data: 

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveenkumar20bps1137/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?select=dataset.csv, detailing various aspects of a student's personal background, academic performance, economic indicators, and more. To be more specific, the dataset includes variables such as marital status, nationality, parents' qualifications and occupations, debtor status, age at enrollment, curricular units performance, among others. Additionally, it includes some economic indicators such as unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP, which provides a broader context to the student's situation.

### Motivation: 

As a first-generation international student, I am deeply intrigued by how these diverse backgrounds may shape the academic outcomes of students in a broad sense. In addition to discerning any potential correlations between these student characteristics and dropout rates, I am also keen on creating a predictive model for students' academic success.

### Research Questions: 

The main question this project seeks to address is: 
- "Can we predict whether a student will drop out or graduate based on their characteristics?"

#### Subsidiary questions include: 

- "Does a correlation exist between the likelihood of dropping out and certain academic attributes"
