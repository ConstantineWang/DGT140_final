This project aims to predict student dropout and academic success based on various student characteristics and academic indicators.

### Data: 

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveenkumar20bps1137/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?select=dataset.csv, detailing various aspects of a student's personal background, academic performance, economic indicators, and more. To be more specific, the dataset includes variables such as marital status, nationality, parents' qualifications and occupations, debtor status, age at enrollment, curricular units performance, among others. Additionally, it includes some economic indicators such as unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP, which provides a broader context to the student's situation.


### Motivation: 

As a international student, I am deeply intrigued by how these diverse backgrounds may shape the academic outcomes of students in a broad sense. In addition to discerning any potential correlations between these student characteristics and dropout rates, I am also keen on creating a predictive model for students' academic success.

### Research Questions: 

- Does our data confirm traditional beliefs about the features that impact on students' academic success?
- What shared traits can we identify among students who tend to drop out of universities?
- Does any overarching societal trait such as GDP and inflation rate significantly influence a student's academic success?
- Beyond these seemingly independent factors, it's important to consider their potential multicollinearity. Are they interrelated, affecting our analysis?
