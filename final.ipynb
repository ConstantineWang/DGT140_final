    "# Student Dropout: An Examination of Student Characteristics and Economic Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict student dropout and academic success based on various student characteristics and academic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5NKx_5EW-w/maxresdefault.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data: \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveenkumar20bps1137/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?select=dataset.csv, detailing various aspects of a student's personal background, academic performance, economic indicators, and more. To be more specific, the dataset includes variables such as marital status, nationality, parents' qualifications and occupations, debtor status, age at enrollment, curricular units performance, among others. Additionally, it includes some economic indicators such as unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP, which provides a broader context to the student's situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation: \n",
    "\n",
    "As a international student, I am deeply intrigued by how these diverse backgrounds may shape the academic outcomes of students in a broad sense. In addition to discerning any potential correlations between these student characteristics and dropout rates, I am also keen on creating a predictive model for students' academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Does our data confirm traditional beliefs about the features that impact on students' academic success?\n",
    "- What shared traits can we identify among students who tend to drop out of universities?\n",
    "- Does any overarching societal trait such as GDP and inflation rate significantly influence a student's academic success?\n",
    "- Beyond these seemingly independent factors, it's important to consider their potential multicollinearity. Are they interrelated, affecting our analysis? \n",

    "We use the following standard cutoffs to categorize the strength of correlations: a strong correlation is indicated by a value greater than 0.5, a medium correlation falls between 0.25 and 0.5, and a weak correlation is represented by a value less than 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these criteria, we observe a number of correlations that align with traditionally held beliefs. For instance, the medium negative correlation between 'Age at enrollment' and the target (-0.3104668) suggests that older students may be more likely to drop out. This supports our earlier assumptions and aligns with our previous data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For positive correlations, there is are strong correlations between 'Curricular units (approved/graded)' for both semesters and student status. The stronger values (0.5538, 0.5963, 0.6484) indicate a higher likelihood of graduation for students with more credited units or higher grades. Furthermore, the medium positive correlation (0.3053657) for 'Scholarship holders' suggests these students, often exhibiting superior academic performance, are more likely to graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these familiar correlations, our analysis uncovers some newer factors tied to student dropout rates. \n",
    "- 'Debtor' demonstrates a medium negative correlation (-0.26465921) with the target, hinting at a higher dropout likelihood for students in debt. Conversely, \n",
    "- 'Tuition fees up to date' shows a medium positive correlation (0.43003638), suggesting students maintaining current tuition payments are more likely to graduate.\n",
    "- 'Gender' has a negative medium strength correlation (-0.24559089), implying that male students may be more likely to drop out than famale students\n",
    "\n",
    "While these interpretations are very meaningful, it's important to emphasize that **correlation does not mean causation**. Thorough investigation is required to fully comprehend these relationships and identify the root causes. For instance, the higher dropout rates among older students or those in debt could be attributed to financial constraints, familial obligations, and a bunch of other factors.\n",

Nonetheless, it is important to consider that these factors may still have potential influences that requires more comprehensive research with larger datasets and longer timeframes.\n",
